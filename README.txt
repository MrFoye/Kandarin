Kandarin is a personal learning project for me to get back into the swing of things programming wise.
This project will show the good, and the bad programming habits i develop along the way. If you wish to contribute anything for some reason, feel free to.
I will be using this repository to problem track, diagnose, and remedy issues within the project. This project will not be for hosting most likely.
It shall not be posted on Rune-Server/Status until i feel i can push out consistent updates to show actual progress. 
If for some wild reason, you decide to download/fork this repository, good luck. This will probably contain bugs, however, feel free to follow!
Journey with me into my mind/thinking process when i actually attempt program.
Have fun!
